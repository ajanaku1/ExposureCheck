Generate a React functional component for a playable, hot-seat version of the game "Dots" with the following specifications:

1. Game Mechanics:
- 5x5 grid of dots displayed on a responsive canvas or div-based grid.
- Players take turns drawing lines between two adjacent dots.
- Lines cannot overlap and cannot connect non-adjacent dots.
- When a player completes a 1x1 box (all 4 lines drawn), award the box to that player and give them an extra turn.
- Keep track of scores for both players and display them prominently.
- When all boxes are claimed, declare the winner.

2. UI & Visuals:
- Each dot should be a visually distinct circle, easy to tap/click.
- Lines should animate smoothly when drawn.
- Completed boxes should fill with a subtle gradient color unique to each player.
- Display whose turn it is clearly.
- Optional: small animation or highlight on the last move to make it visually satisfying.

3. Interactivity:
- Implement tap/click handling for line drawing.
- Highlight dots or lines on hover to indicate valid moves.
- Prevent invalid moves with proper feedback (e.g., ignore click or show subtle animation).

4. State Management:
- Use React hooks (useState, useEffect) to manage game state.
- Represent the grid, drawn lines, completed boxes, current turn, and scores as part of the state.
- The game should be fully playable in a single session (no backend needed for hot-seat version).

5. Optional Enhancements:
- Make it mobile-friendly (tap targets large enough, responsive layout).
- Smooth animations when drawing lines or completing boxes.
- Add a simple “Reset Game” button to start a new match.

6. Code Style:
- Write clean, readable React code with clear variable names.
- Modularize components where appropriate (e.g., Dot, Line, Box, Scoreboard).
- Include brief comments explaining key logic sections.

The output should be a complete React component (or set of components) that can be directly rendered and played in a React app. Prioritize **gameplay first**, then visuals. Use modern React best practices.
